Run `sass --watch scss:css` in the terminal to track changes in SCSS files and automagically compile them into CSS files.

## Features
- A nice CSS3 animation
- You can click "Hey" to view other funny greetings

## Ideas

- There are just three icons, do I really need the entire fontawesome library? (loaded via JS)
- Loading the three icons takes a few seconds, I should show them with an animation when they are ready.
- Choose a better color for text selection
- Add a fade-in animation to the spinner, it doean't look good it's already rotating at page load, too many thing to look at at once (you could also show that first and then the text)
