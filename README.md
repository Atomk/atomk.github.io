Run `sass --watch scss:css` in the terminal to track changes in SCSS files and automagically compile them into CSS files.

## Features
- A nice CSS3 animation
- You can click "Hey" to view other funny greetings

## Ideas

- There are just three icons, do I really need the entire fontawesome library? (loaded via JS)
- [ ] Loading the three icons takes a few seconds, I should show them with an animation when they are ready.
